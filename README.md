- Gmail account credentials (for sending email receipts)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:


2. Install dependencies:


3. Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:
  - MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_url
  - RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
  - RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret
  - GMAIL_USER=your_gmail_username
  - GMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_password

## Usage
Access the Student Management System through your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/admin`.

## Endpoints
- `/admin`: View and manage student records.
- `/addStudent`: Add a new student.
- `/toggleFeesPaid/:id`: Toggle a student's fee payment status.
- `/deleteStudent/:id`: Delete a student.
- `/payment`: Accept online fee payments.
- `/feesdo`: Show the payment receipt.

## Database
The application uses MongoDB for storing student and fee payment records. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that should be set up separately. Update the `MONGODB_URI` in the `.env` file with your database connection URL.

## Online Fee Payment
Razorpay is used to accept online fee payments. You will need to obtain API credentials from the Razorpay dashboard and set the `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` in the `.env` file.

## Cron Job
A cron job is scheduled to run on the 5th day of each month at 12:00 AM to reset the `feesPaid` field to false for all students. This is done using the `node-cron` library.
